# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** using machine learning techniques. The model uses applicant details such as income, credit history, employment status, and loan amount to make predictions.  


## Project Overview
Loan approval prediction is a real-world classification problem in the banking and finance sector. This project applies **supervised machine learning algorithms** to predict the likelihood of loan approval based on historical data.
